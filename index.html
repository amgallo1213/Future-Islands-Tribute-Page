            <p id="p-1">Formed in North Carolina in 2006, Future Islands is a modern synth-pop band featuring Samuel Herring (vocalist), Gerrit Welmers (keyboards & programming), William Cashion (bass, guitar, acoustic guitar), and Michael Lowery (percussion).</p>
            <p>Singer Samuel Herring describes their music as "Where the songs have always been kind of upbeat and happy, the message is often melancholy.
                I like it that way, people's natural instinct is to let their guards down and dance, and then they actually let the words seep in. Instead of turning away from the darkness,
                they embrace the light and find the darkness. I think the opposite is true too."</p>
            <p>Future Islands concerts are a not-to-be-missed experience as Herring dances and gyrates across the stage, writhing with the beat and lyrics. At times Herring seems to be 
                having a conversation to another person on the stage, looming over them seranading them with stories and life lessons. Herring's movements evoke the movements of a 
                modern dancer and a boxer. He beats his chest and, at times the stage, forcing the audience to feel the weight of his lyrics. </p>
